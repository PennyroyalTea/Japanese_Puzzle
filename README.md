# Nonogram
Creates .tex code from picture which can be compiled to get a .bpm nonogram. Uses pure Java.

To process your image, put it in project folder, call it image.bpm, then compile and run Runner.java from src.
If everything go succesfully, you will get puzzle.tex which now can be easily compiled to PDF representation of your nonogram by any latex compiler.
